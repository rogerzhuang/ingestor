This was achieved from production ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in 2022, at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. There was also an increase in production and an increase in the average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher proportion of Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\\n\\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $10 million, or 3%, in the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to changes in pricing in certain regions.\\n\\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue increased $151 million, or 17%, in the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 for credits sold previously, in the absence of which we had a decrease in automotive regulatory credits revenue driven by lower sales of regulatory credits.\\n\\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $256 million, or 77%, in the three months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2021. Automotive leasing revenue increased $627 million, or 100%, in the six months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2021.
